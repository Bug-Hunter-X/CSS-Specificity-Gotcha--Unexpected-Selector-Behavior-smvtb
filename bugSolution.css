To reliably override the style of the nested paragraph, increase the specificity of the selector. There are several ways to do this:

**1. Increase Specificity:**
Add more specific selectors. For instance, adding a class to the div or paragraph elements will increase specificity.

```css
div.myClass #myElement p {
  color: blue;
}
```

**2. Using !important:** (Use sparingly and with caution)

```css
div#myElement p {
  color: blue !important;
}
```

**3. Order of Rules:**
Sometimes, the order of rules matters. If you place the more specific rule *after* a less specific rule, it might not override it. Ensure the more specific selector appears later in your stylesheet.

```css
p {
  color: red;
}
div#myElement p {
  color: blue; 
}
```
Choosing the best solution depends on your code structure.  Adding more specific selectors generally provides a cleaner, more maintainable solution than using `!important`.
